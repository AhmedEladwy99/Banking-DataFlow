# Banking-DataFlow

📡 **Banking-DataFlow** is a real-time data engineering pipeline designed for customer churn prediction. It processes messy, multi-format data from various telecom systems, performs complex transformations, enforces schema validation, encrypts sensitive information, and uploads cleaned data to HDFS for downstream analysis and machine learning models.

---
## 🚀 Project Overview

TeleConnect, a Banking company, is facing high customer churn. This project helps by:

- Integrating and cleaning real-time data from 6 different sources (CSV, JSON, TXT).
- Transforming and enriching datasets with calculated insights.
- Encrypting sensitive message content using a Caesar cipher.
- Saving transformed data in Parquet format and uploading to HDFS.
- Supporting the Data Science team with ML-ready, structured data.

## 📊 Suggested Analyses

The transformed data enables rich analysis for churn prediction and business insight. Some suggested directions include:

- **Churn Analysis**
  - Identify customer segments (age, city, tenure) with high churn.
  - Correlate churn with late payment behavior and service complaints.

- **Revenue Analysis**
  - Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).
  - Compare revenue between churners and loyal customers.

- **Behavior Trend Analysis**
  - Explore usage patterns (data, calls, messages) that indicate churn risk.
  - Track drop in engagement over time.

- **Geographic Insights**
  - Highlight cities/regions with higher churn or complaints.
